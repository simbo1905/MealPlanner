# Flutter Meal Planner: Alignment Fix & DND Testing Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-17  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - All Issues Fixed and Tested

---

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Alignment Problem
**Problem**: Day numbers (17, 18, 19) were on the left, but meal cards were indented too far right (90px), creating visual disconnect.

**Fix**: 
- Changed padding from `EdgeInsets.fromLTRB(90, 8, 24, 24)` to `EdgeInsets.only(left: 85, right: 24, top: 8, bottom: 24)`
- Applied consistent padding to both empty and filled days
- Result: Cards now align 85px from left edge, creating clear visual grouping with day numbers

**Before**: Cards were 90px+ from left, appearing disconnected from day numbers  
**After**: Cards are 85px from left, visually grouped with day headers

---

### Issue 2: Empty Days Not Valid Drop Targets
**Problem**: When a day had no events, only the "+ Add" button was visible with no drag-and-drop target zone. Users couldn't drag meals to empty days.

**Fix**:
- Wrapped entire day area in `DragTarget<Map<String, dynamic>>`
- Added `minHeight: 80` constraint to ensure empty days have sufficient drop zone area
- Added blue border highlight (`2px solid`) and tint (`10% opacity`) on hover
- Added `borderRadius: 8` for polished appearance

**Result**: Empty days now accept drag-and-drop across entire day region, with clear visual feedback

---

### Issue 3: Drag-and-Drop Not Working
**Problem**: Drag-and-drop was not implemented.

**Fix**:
- Wrapped each meal card in `Draggable<Map<String, dynamic>>` widget
- Passes `{event, fromDay}` data payload
- Implemented elevated shadow feedback (`elevation: 4`)
- Source card opacity reduces to 30% during drag
- Drop triggers `_moveMeal()` which:
  - Removes event from source day
  - Creates new event on target day
  - Updates both `_mealsByDay` state and `EventsController`

**Result**: Full drag-and-drop functionality with polished visual feedback

---

### Issue 4: Delete Button Not Working
**Problem**: Lightning bolt icon was decorative, but users expected it to delete.

**Fix**:
- Added `IconButton` with `Icons.close` (✖) to each meal card
- Wired to `_removeMeal()` function
- Lightning bolt (`Icons.bolt`) remains purely decorative for quick meals (≤45 min)
- Added key: `delete-meal-{dayKey}-{index}` for testing

**Result**: Clear, intuitive delete action

---

### Issue 5: Week Number Not Updating on Scroll
**Problem**: Week badge showed fixed week number, not the currently visible week.

**Fix**:
- Added `ScrollController` to `EventsList`
- Added `_onScroll()` listener that:
  - Calculates scroll offset
  - Estimates visible date from scroll position
  - Computes week start using Monday-first ISO logic
  - Updates `_visibleWeekStart` state when week changes
- Week badge and range now reflect currently visible week

**Result**: Week info dynamically updates as user scrolls through calendar

```

**Test Breakdown**:
1. ✅ Browser: add/delete/drag works end-to-end
2. ✅ Today is highlighted distinctly
3. ✅ Activity count updates dynamically
4. ✅ Reset button clears all meals

## Visual Comparison

### Before (Screenshot 2025-10-17 at 06.52.37.png):
- Day 17: Number on left, "New Meal" card far right → **90px+ gap**
- Day 18: Number on left, "+ Add" button far right → **inconsistent**
- Day 19: Number on left, "Chicken Stir-Fry" card far right → **disconnected**

### After (fixed_alignment_verification.png):
- Day 17: Number on left, "+ Add" button aligned **85px** → **visually grouped**
- Day 18: Number on left, "+ Add" button aligned **85px** → **consistent**
- Day 19: Number on left, "Chicken Stir-Fry" card aligned **85px** → **cohesive**
