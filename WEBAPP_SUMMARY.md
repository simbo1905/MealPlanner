# MealPlanner Svelte Webapp - Implementation Summary

## Completed Work

### 1. Prototype Analysis ✅
- Started and analyzed prototype/02 (NextJS mockup) using Playwright MCP
- Captured screenshots of all screens:
  - Calendar view with weekly grid layout
  - Add Meal dialog with recipe search
  - Ingredient filtering dropdown
- Documented all UI features and interactions

### 2. Svelte Components Created ✅

**CalendarView.svelte** (`apps/web/src/lib/components/CalendarView.svelte`)
- 4-week calendar grid layout matching prototype design
- Day columns showing: day name, date, and meals
- Add button for each day
- Meal cards with recipe title, cooking time, and remove functionality
- Reset button to clear all meals
- Save button with localStorage persistence
- Total meals count display

**AddMealDialog.svelte** (`apps/web/src/lib/components/AddMealDialog.svelte`)
- Modal dialog matching prototype design
- Search textbox for recipe search
- Ingredient dropdown with tag filtering
- Selected tags displayed as removable badges
- Recipe list showing title and cooking time
- Integrates with existing recipe store for search functionality
- Close button and backdrop click to dismiss

**App.svelte** (Updated)
- Tab navigation between Calendar View and Recipe Explorer
- Clean routing between views
- Responsive layout

### 3. Recipe Data ✅
Updated `packages/recipe-database/data/recipes.json` with recipes matching the prototype:
- Spaghetti Bolognese (45 min)
- Chicken Stir-Fry (30 min)
- Fish and Chips (40 min)
- Vegetable Curry (35 min)
- Roast Chicken (90 min)

### 4. Integration with Existing Code ✅
- Uses existing recipe store (`$lib/stores/recipes.ts`)
- Imports from `@mealplanner/recipe-database` package
- Compatible with RecipeExplorer component
- Follows Svelte 5 runes pattern
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling

## Justfile Commands

### Development
```bash
# Start webapp dev server (requires pnpm fix first)
just webapp start
# or
just dev-webapp

# Build webapp
just build-webapp

# Stop webapp server
just webapp stop
```

### Mobile Deployment
```bash
# Build and deploy to iOS
just deploy-ios

# Build and deploy to Android
just deploy-android
```

## Critical Blockers

### ❌ pnpm Store Corruption
The pnpm store is corrupted and blocking all package installations. This **MUST** be fixed before the webapp can run.

**Fix steps documented in:** `MANUAL_STEPS.md`

```bash
# Quick fix (run these commands):
rm -rf ~/.pnpm-store ~/.local/share/pnpm/store
cd /Users/Shared/MealPlanner
rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install
pnpm build:packages
pnpm build:web
```

### ⚠️ Cleanup Needed
Remove contaminated iOS directories:
```bash
rm -rf apps/ios/webapp
rm -rf apps/ios/Resources/webapp
```

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Svelte 5 with runes
- **Build**: Vite 6
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Date handling**: date-fns
- **State**: Svelte stores
- **TypeScript packages**: recipe-types, recipe-validator, recipe-database

### Project Structure
```
apps/web/
  src/
    lib/
      components/
        CalendarView.svelte         # NEW - Calendar grid
        AddMealDialog.svelte        # NEW - Add meal modal
        RecipeExplorer.svelte       # Existing recipe browser
      stores/
        recipes.ts                  # Recipe search state
    App.svelte                      # Main app with tabs
    main.ts                         # Entry point
```

### Data Flow
1. Recipe database loads from `packages/recipe-database/data/recipes.json`
2. Recipe store provides search/filter functionality
3. CalendarView maintains calendar state in Svelte store
4. AddMealDialog uses recipe store for search
5. Selected meals saved to localStorage for persistence

## Testing Plan

### Once pnpm is fixed:

1. **Build packages**
   ```bash
   pnpm build:packages
   ```

2. **Start webapp**
   ```bash
   just webapp start
   ```

3. **Visual comparison with Playwright**
   ```bash
   # Compare with prototype screenshots
   # - /tmp/playwright-mcp-output/1760133052455/prototype-calendar-main.png
   # - /tmp/playwright-mcp-output/1760133052455/prototype-add-meal-dialog.png
   # - /tmp/playwright-mcp-output/1760133052455/prototype-ingredient-dropdown.png
   ```

4. **Functional testing**
   - Add meals to calendar days
   - Search recipes by text
   - Filter by ingredient tags
   - Remove meals from calendar
   - Save and reload calendar
   - Switch between Calendar and Recipe Explorer views

## Known Differences from Prototype

### Intentional Design Improvements
1. **Tab Navigation**: Added tabs to switch between Calendar and Recipe Explorer (prototype only had calendar)
2. **Recipe Icons**: Using generic utensils icon (prototype had varied icons)
3. **Color Scheme**: Using Tailwind defaults (can be customized to match prototype exactly)

### Features from Prototype
- ✅ Weekly calendar grid (4 weeks)
- ✅ Day headers with name and date
- ✅ Add button on each day
- ✅ Meal cards with title and time
- ✅ Add Meal dialog with search
- ✅ Ingredient tag filtering
- ✅ Recipe list with cooking times
- ✅ Save functionality
- ✅ Reset button
- ✅ Total meals count

## Next Steps (After pnpm Fix)

1. Fix pnpm store corruption (see MANUAL_STEPS.md)
2. Build and verify packages
3. Start webapp and test functionality
4. Use Playwright to compare with prototype screenshots
5. Fine-tune styling to match prototype exactly
6. Test mobile deployment to iOS/Android
7. Run verifier agent to validate code quality

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `apps/web/src/lib/components/CalendarView.svelte`
- `apps/web/src/lib/components/AddMealDialog.svelte`
- `MANUAL_STEPS.md` (manual fix instructions)
