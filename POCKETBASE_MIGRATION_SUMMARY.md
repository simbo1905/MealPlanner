# PocketBase Migration Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-21  
**Status**: Event-Sourced Store Implementation Complete

## Overview

Successfully migrated from CloudKit to PocketBase 0.30.x as the backend for MealPlanner. Implemented:
1. Local development infrastructure (setup script, health checks)
2. Flutter offline-first integration (recipe CRUD, caching)
3. **Event-sourced architecture** (3×64-bit UUIDs, append-only edits, conflict resolution)

---

## Event-Sourced Store Architecture (NEW)

### Summary

All entity changes are captured as **immutable events** in a local buffer, then flushed to PocketBase in background isolate. Supports offline editing, undo/redo, and deterministic conflict resolution via longest-chain + timestamp arbitration.

**See**: [`EVENT_STORE_ARCHITECTURE.md`](./EVENT_STORE_ARCHITECTURE.md) for complete API, state machine, and testing guide.

## PocketBase Collection Schema

### Collections: recipes_v1, edits, snapshots

#### recipes_v1 (Legacy CRUD)

| Field | Type | Required | Indexed | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------|
| id | text | auto | yes | Primary key (auto-generated) |
| title | text | yes | yes | Recipe name |
| description | text | no | no | Short description |
| total_time | number | yes | no | Cook time in minutes |
| status | select | yes | no | Options: Draft, Complete |
| is_deleted | bool | yes | yes | Soft delete flag (default: false) |
| recipe_json | json | no | no | Full JTD-compliant document |
| created | datetime | auto | no | Creation timestamp |
| updated | datetime | auto | no | Last modified timestamp |

**API Rules:**
- List: `filter: is_deleted = false`
- Create/Update: authenticated user
- Delete: soft delete only (set is_deleted = true)

---

#### edits (Append-Only Events – NEW)

| Field | Type | Required | Indexed | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------|
| id | text | auto | **unique** | Full 3-part UUID `timeMs:counter:deviceHash` |
| entity_id | text | yes | **yes** | First part of UUID (timeMs) |
| prior_version | number | yes | no | Previous event's `next_version` |
| next_version | number | yes | **yes** | Monotonic counter (composite index with entity_id) |
| event_type | select | yes | no | Options: CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE |
| new_state_json | json | yes | no | Full entity state after event |
| created | datetime | auto | no | Auto-timestamp |

**Indexes**:
- `idx_edits_entity_id` on `entity_id`
- `idx_edits_entity_version` composite on `(entity_id, next_version)`

**API Rules**:
- List: authenticated user (read-only)
- Create: authenticated user (append-only)
- Update: never
- Delete: never

**Read Pattern**: 
```
GET /api/collections/edits/records
  ?filter=entity_id="1716283456789"
  &sort=next_version
```

Returns: full event history in version order

---

#### snapshots (Current State Cache – NEW)

| Field | Type | Required | Indexed | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------|
| id | text | auto | unique | Entity ID (same as first part of UUID) |
| version | number | yes | **yes** | Latest `next_version` from `edits` |
| type_version | text | yes | no | Schema version string (e.g., "Recipe:v1") |
| state_json | json | yes | no | Materialized current state |
| deleted | bool | yes | **yes** | Soft-delete flag (hides from list) |
| latest_handle_version | number | no | no | Concurrency guard (TBD) |
| created | datetime | auto | no | Auto-timestamp |
| updated | datetime | auto | no | Auto-timestamp |

**Indexes**:
- `idx_snapshots_version` on `version`
- `idx_snapshots_deleted` on `deleted`

**API Rules**:
- List: `filter: deleted = false && @request.auth.id != ''`  (authenticated users only)
- View: authenticated user
- Create: authenticated user (via event flush)
- Update: authenticated user (idempotent upsert)
- Delete: never (use soft-delete)

**Upsert Pattern**:
```
POST /api/collections/snapshots/records
{
  "id": "1716283456789",
  "version": 42,
  "type_version": "Recipe:v1",
  "state_json": { ... },
  "deleted": false,
  "latest_handle_version": 1
}
```

## Test Data Seeded

5 Sample Recipes:
1. Chicken Stir-Fry (30 min, 2 ingredients)
2. Roast Chicken (90 min, 1 ingredient)
3. Spaghetti Bolognese (45 min, 2 ingredients)
4. Vegetable Curry (40 min, 2 ingredients)
5. Fish and Chips (35 min, 2 ingredients)

---

## Testing Commands

**Setup PocketBase:**
```bash
just pocketbase-setup
```

**Start Server:**
```bash
just pocketbase start
```

**Check Status:**
```bash
just pocketbase status
```

**View Logs:**
```bash
just pocketbase logs
```

**Reset (Fresh Instance):**
```bash
just pocketbase reset
```

**Run Flutter App:**
```bash
cd meal_planner
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

**Manual Testing Flow:**
1. Start PocketBase: `just pocketbase start`
2. Visit Admin UI: http://127.0.0.1:8091/_/
3. Create admin user with credentials from config
4. Create `recipes_v1` collection with schema above
5. Run Flutter app: `flutter run -d chrome`
6. Tap experimental icon (science beaker in AppBar)
7. See experimental screen with empty state
8. Service will auto-seed 5 test recipes
9. Verify CRUD operations work
10. Stop PocketBase: `just pocketbase stop`
11. Verify offline banner appears in app
12. Start PocketBase again: `just pocketbase start`
13. Verify app reconnects and syncs

---

## Known Limitations (MVP Scope)

1. **Simplified Recipe Form**: Only title, description, and total_time editable. Full ingredient/steps editor deferred.
2. **No Advanced Search**: Linear scan only (acceptable for <512 recipes).
3. **Manual Admin Setup**: First run requires visiting Admin UI to create user.
4. **No Collection Migration**: Collection schema must be created manually via Admin UI.
5. **No Sync Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins pattern (acceptable for single-user MVP).
6. **No Background Sync**: Offline writes not queued for later sync yet.

---

## Next Steps (Not Implemented)

1. Integration test (`pocketbase_crud_test.dart`)
2. Update `flutter_test_server.sh` to manage PocketBase lifecycle
3. Collection migration script for automated schema setup
4. Full recipe editor with ingredients and steps
5. Background sync queue for offline writes
6. Image upload support
7. Recipe search/filter UI

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Platform Agnostic**: PocketBase runs identically on macOS, Linux, Windows
2. **Self-Contained**: No external cloud dependencies for development
3. **Type Safe**: Full Dart type safety with PocketBase SDK
4. **Offline First**: Local cache + sync pattern prevents data loss
5. **Timestamped Instances**: Easy rollback and debugging via `pb_<timestamp>/` dirs
6. **Scriptable**: Python setup + Bash management = automation-friendly
7. **Extensible**: JS hooks support for future server-side logic

---

## Security Notes

- ⚠️ Dev credentials (`dev123456`) are trivial - **local development only**
- ⚠️ No TLS in dev mode - connections are HTTP not HTTPS
- ⚠️ Admin API exposed on localhost - **never expose port 8091 publicly**
- ⚠️ No rate limiting in dev mode
- ✅ Soft deletes enable recovery and audit trail
- ✅ All writes go through authenticated admin session
- ✅ Collection rules enforce `is_deleted = false` filter on list operations

---

## Success Criteria Met

- [x] PocketBase 0.30.4 downloaded and configured
- [x] Local dev server runs on port 8091
- [x] Timestamped instance management with `pb_current` symlink
- [x] Flutter app connects and authenticates
- [x] CRUD operations functional (create, read, update, soft delete)
- [x] Offline detection and cache fallback working
- [x] Experimental screen accessible via AppBar icon
- [x] Test data seeding operational
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] .gitignore prevents committing PocketBase artifacts

---

## How to Verify

```bash
# 1. Setup and start PocketBase
just pocketbase-setup
just pocketbase start

# 2. Check it's running
just pocketbase status
curl http://127.0.0.1:8091/api/health

# 3. Run Flutter app
cd meal_planner
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome

# 4. In the app:
# - Click science icon in AppBar
# - Should see experimental screen
# - Recipes should auto-seed on first load
# - Try adding a new recipe
# - Try editing an existing recipe
# - Try deleting via swipe

# 5. Test offline mode
just pocketbase stop
# - App should show orange offline banner
# - Cached recipes still visible
# - Write operations will fail gracefully

# 6. Test reconnection
just pocketbase start
# - Offline banner should disappear
# - Pull-to-refresh should work
```

This completes the core PocketBase migration. Integration tests and test server updates are deferred as documented in the plan.
