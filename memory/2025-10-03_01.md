# Memory Entry: 2025-10-03_01 - SPTV Meal Planning User Research

**Date**: 2025-10-03  
**Feature**: 001-sptv-meal-planning  
**Type**: User Research / Decision Log  
**Participants**: Busy parent (target persona - author has personal experience of meal planning challenges)  

## Context
User clarification session conducted via spec-kit `/clarify` workflow to validate assumptions about busy parents' meal planning needs before technical implementation.

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Planning Period Strategy
**Decision**: Default to 14-day (fortnight) planning period with configuration options greyed out in first prototype
**User Evidence**: "14 days (fortnight) as specified, with configuration option greyed out in first prototype for future expansion to weekly/variable periods"
**Rationale**: Users want fortnightly planning but value future flexibility without complexity upfront
**Implementation**: Simple portion number selector (default 4) that becomes sticky per user

### 2. Recipe Source Architecture  
**Decision**: System provides meal planning framework, users supply their own recipes via initially out-of-band method and later LLM integration/automation
**User Evidence**: "Users provide their own recipes via LLM integration - system provides planning framework rather than curated meal suggestions"
**Rationale**: Users know what works for their family and have meals they already have in their backpocket yet are looking to expand when time allows
**Impact**: Stop the bleed on administration overhead to free up capacity to add cround sourced suggestions. 

### 3. Supermarket Integration Approach
**Decision**: Support all major UK supermarkets with copy-paste export formats initially
**User Evidence**: "All major UK supermarkets supported - API integration is the hard challenge as they have no public APIs"
**Rationale**: Cannot expect busy parents to change supermarkets; API access is technical challenge
**Technical Note**: UK supermarkets have no public APIs - export formats (email) and browser automation are initial approach

### 4. Family Sizing UX Strategy
**Decision**: Default to 4 portions with simple number adjustment. Portion count collected at first shopping list generation time
**User Evidence**: "Default 2 adults/2 children with 0.66 child portion scaling. Family size collected at shopping commitment time to reduce on-ramp barriers"
**Rationale**: Simplified approach - just ask "how many portions" with default 4. Users can adjust to 3/2/5 and it becomes sticky. Parents manage leftovers and shopping judgment naturally.
**Implementation**: Simple portion number selector (default 4) that becomes sticky per user
**UX Insight**: Complex child scaling is impractical - parents naturally manage portions and leftovers

### 5. Budget Sensitivity Design
**Decision**: No explicit budget features - substitution suggestions may provide cost-conscious alternatives 
**User Evidence**: "No explicit budget features - substitution suggestions provide cost-conscious alternatives without embarrassing users"
**Rationale**: Users don't want to feel judged about spending; prefer subtle cost-saving options
**Approach**: Implicit cost consciousness through ingredient substitutions

## Technical Challenges Identified
1. **API Integration**: UK supermarkets have no public APIs - copy-paste export is initial approach
3. **On-Ramp Barriers**: Family sizing collection timing is critical for user adoption

## UX Insights Discovered
1. **Commitment Timing**: Collect family details at shopping moment, not signup
2. **Budget Sensitivity**: Users want cost options without feeling judged
3. **Content Control**: Users prefer bringing own recipes vs. curated suggestions
4. **Flexibility vs Simplicity**: Grey out advanced options, don't hide them

## Project Memory Nuggets
- Family sizing: Simple "how many portions" with default 4, sticky per user
- Supermarket API integration is the hard technical challenge
- Portion collection should be at shopping list generation time (when users think about quantities)
- Substitution system should offer cost-effective alternatives without explicit budget features

## Evidence Quality
**Source**: Direct user clarification session with target persona  
**Method**: Structured questioning via spec-kit workflow  
**Confidence**: High - primary source validation  
**Coverage**: 5 critical areas resolved with detailed rationale

## Related Decisions
- Feature scope validated before technical planning
- User autonomy prioritized over content curation
- Professional British English transcription standards applied
- Transparent annotation for genuine ambiguities only

**Next Action**: Proceed to technical planning phase with validated requirements
