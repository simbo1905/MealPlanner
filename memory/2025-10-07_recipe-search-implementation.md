# Learning Log: Recipe Search Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Context**: Adding searchable recipe database to prototype/02 calendar view  
**Status**: Completed and migrated to shared packages

## Original Request

Enhance prototype/02 calendar view to replace fixed meal list with a searchable database containing JDT RFC 8927 compliant recipes. Users should be able to:
- Search by free text (title/description)
- Filter by ingredients (tags)
- Combine search modes
- See results update in real-time

## Implementation Approach

### Data Model
Created TypeScript model matching JDT RFC 8927 schema with:
- Recipe structure with title, ingredients, steps, time, etc.
- Ingredient structure with dual measurement system (UCUM + metric)
- Allergen codes following EU regulation 1169/2011
- Strict validation with detailed error messages

### Search Functionality
Implemented three search modes:
1. **Free text search**: Searches title, description, ingredients (case-insensitive)
2. **Ingredient tags**: Searches only ingredient names (exact word matching)
3. **Combined search**: Both free text + ingredient filters with relevance scoring

### UI Integration
- Search input box for free text queries
- Tag system for ingredient filtering
- "#word" syntax to create new ingredient tags
- Visual tag chips with remove buttons
- Real-time search results update
- Search across all recipe fields with highlighting

## Example Recipes
Added 5 complete recipes matching prototype examples:
1. Spaghetti Bolognese (45 min) - Italian pasta with meat sauce
2. Chicken Stir-Fry (30 min) - Asian-inspired chicken and vegetables
3. Fish and Chips (40 min) - British classic with battered fish
4. Vegetable Curry (35 min) - Fragrant vegetarian curry
5. Roast Chicken (90 min) - Perfectly seasoned roasted chicken

## Technical Implementation

### Module Structure
Created separate TypeScript module for database:
- Clear API with searchRecipes() method
- localStorage integration for persistence
- Default tags: "chicken", "fish", "vegetables"
- Tag management: loadTags(), addTag()

### Search API
```typescript
// Free text search
searchRecipes({ query: "roast chicken" })

// Ingredient tag search  
searchRecipes({ ingredients: ["chicken", "vegetables"] })

// Combined search
searchRecipes({ 
  query: "quick",
  ingredients: ["chicken"],
  maxTime: 30
})
```

## Migration to Shared Packages

This prototype implementation was later extracted into production-ready shared packages:
- `@mealplanner/recipe-types` - TypeScript interfaces
- `@mealplanner/recipe-validator` - JDT validation
- `@mealplanner/recipe-database` - Search functionality

See `specs/003-recipe-api/spec.md` for full API documentation.

## Learnings

### What Worked Well
1. **JDT RFC 8927**: Strict validation caught many edge cases early
2. **Modular Design**: Separate database module made it easy to extract later
3. **Tag System**: Simple "#word" syntax was intuitive for users
4. **Test Data**: Using realistic recipes helped validate search behavior

### Challenges
1. **UCUM Units**: Complex unit system required careful validation
2. **Search Relevance**: Balancing multiple search criteria for good ranking
3. **Tag Creation**: Needed to prevent duplicate tags and handle case sensitivity
4. **Performance**: Large recipe datasets required optimization

### Future Improvements
- User preferences for curating tags
- Advanced filters (dietary restrictions, cuisine types)
- Recipe scaling with automatic quantity adjustment
- Nutritional information and analysis
- Cloud sync for cross-device access
