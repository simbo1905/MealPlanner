So my main objective by commissioning this app from Simon is to have a pool of resources, recipes, and ideas, then I can use to construct a weekly meal planner. So it has to it has to give me ideas based around favourite ingredients and it has to give me ideas based on time available to do those recipes. So there can be recipes that if I say, I can have two hours to cook, then it's a more elaborate recipe or if I have 30 minutes, a quick recipe. So that's the main criteria. Then I need from that pool of recipes, I need to be able to move them and drag them on the day of the week of choice, depending again on availability, who is coming for dinner, etc. So that's number two, being able to put them on the calendar. And number three is for that recipe for to export into a shopping list for the week to avoid having to do daily shopping. So everything that needs purchasing for the week can be done in one single shopping trip.
