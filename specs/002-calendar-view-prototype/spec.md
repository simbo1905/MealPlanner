## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a busy parent planning weekly meals, I want to see a visual calendar view where I can add recipe cards onto specific days, so I can quickly organise my family's meals based on our schedule.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am viewing the weekly scrolling calendar with vertically scrolling weeks, **When** I add a recipe to a specific day in the calendar, **Then** the recipe becomes assigned to that day and remains visually attached to it

2. **Given** I am viewing the weekly calendar with vertically scrolling weeks, **When** I continuously scroll through different days and weeks, **Then** I can see multiple days weeks of meal planning with smooth, responsive scrolling and my meal assignments persist

3. **Given** I have assigned meals to days, **When** I want to change a meal to a different day, **Then** I can drag the meal from one day to another day seamlessly

4. **Given** I have assigned a meail to a day, **When** I tap on the recipe card, **Then** a recipe specific banner floats up from the bottom that has the title, a thumbnail, and buttons. Tapping on the title or image opens up the recipe in its own page. 

### Edge Cases
- Q: What happens when a user tries to drag a recipe to a day that already has a meal planned?
  A: Up to three cards can fit into the screen to hold breakfast, lunch, dinner yet more cards can be added that shift existing cards to the right which may move out of view. 
- Q: How does the system handle dragging multiple recipes to the same day?
  A: It does not only a single card may be dragged at a time. 
- Q: What feedback is provided when a drag operation is unsuccessful?
  A: None the card will spring back to where it was. 
- Q: How are recipes returned to the pool if removed from a calendar day?
  A: If a user taps on the card, a a recipe specific banner floats up from the bottom that has the title, a thumbnail, and buttons. There is a remove button that causes the banner to close and the card to be removed from the weekly scrolling calendar.

- **Calendar Day**: Represents a single day in the meal planning calendar that can accept recipe assignments and displays assigned meals
- **Meal Assignment**: Represents the relationship between a recipe and a specific calendar day, including assignment timestamp
- **Recipe Pool**: A logical database of recipes that are covered by a different set of screens from which a user may assign a recipes to a given day.
