**Feature Branch**: `006-conditional-splash-screen`
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: GitHub Issue #10 – "Conditional Multi-Mode Splash Screen Specification"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a MealPlanner stakeholder launching different build variants, I want the app to present a polished splash animation for production users while giving internal teams an instant debug launcher, so that each audience gets the right startup experience without manual configuration.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I install a production/release build, **When** I launch the app, **Then** I see the animated rotation splash for at least four seconds and I am taken automatically to the main home screen without needing to interact.
2. **Given** I install a debug/development build, **When** the app starts, **Then** I land on a developer launcher screen that clearly lists navigation shortcuts including "Go to Home Screen", "Preview Splash Animation", and designated test destinations.
3. **Given** I am on the debug developer launcher, **When** I tap "Preview Splash Animation", **Then** the production splash animation plays in a loop until I explicitly dismiss it and returning takes me back to the launcher.
4. **Given** I launch a production build and the intro animation is still running, **When** the timeout completes or the animation loop finishes, **Then** the splash dismisses itself (without user input) and the home experience is fully interactive with no intermediate blank screens.
5. **Given** the developer launcher lists experimental screens, **When** a screen remains unimplemented, **Then** selecting it surfaces a clear placeholder state instead of crashing or presenting a blank page.
6. **Given** build mode detection runs at startup, **When** I rebuild the app in a different mode (debug vs release), **Then** the corresponding entry experience updates immediately on next cold-start without requiring cache clears.

### Edge Cases
- App launched in release mode while the animation asset fails to load (fallback behavior).
- Debug launcher returning to foreground from background mid-navigation.
- Devices with extremely fast cold-starts (splash still needs minimum display time).
- Web or desktop builds where splash assets or developer launcher controls need responsive layout adjustments.
- Automation suites that rely on deterministic startup (ensure test hooks are documented).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST evaluate build mode (debug/profile/release) synchronously before rendering any first screen.
- **FR-002**: Release builds MUST default to the animated splash experience and transition automatically to the primary home screen after the configured timeout (4–6 seconds).
- **FR-003**: Debug builds MUST bypass the animated splash on cold start and render the developer launcher as the first interactive UI.
- **FR-004**: Developer launcher MUST provide labelled navigation actions for: Home Screen, Splash Preview, and a configurable list of test/experimental screens supplied by the team.
- **FR-005**: Splash preview invoked from debug mode MUST reuse the production animation component, loop indefinitely, and dismiss via tap/back without side effects.
- **FR-006**: Navigation from developer launcher MUST share the same routing system as production so deep links and analytics remain consistent.
- **FR-007**: Unimplemented destinations MUST resolve to a consistent placeholder state with messaging instead of throwing.
- **FR-008**: All entry paths MUST avoid initializing user data or backend calls until after the destination screen is visible, respecting the original issue constraints.
- **FR-009**: Build mode decisions MUST remain constant for the entire session; hot reload or resumed states must not mix launcher and splash flows.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Splash animation MUST target 60 FPS on representative hardware, with a graceful fallback (static image) if device performance drops below 30 FPS.
- **NFR-002**: Startup pathway selection MUST complete within 50ms so that no perceptible delay occurs before initial UI renders.
- **NFR-003**: Developer launcher interactions MUST be discoverable via accessibility services and fully operable with screen readers.
- **NFR-004**: Logging MUST tag startup path decisions with `APP_ENTRY_MODE` (`production_splash` vs `debug_launcher`) for QA verification.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **BuildModeContext**: Captures runtime build flags (`isDebug`, `isProfile`, `isRelease`) and derived entry mode.
- **EntryRouteRegistry**: Maintains mapping between launcher buttons and app route names plus safety metadata (implemented vs placeholder).
- **SplashTimingConfig**: Stores animation asset references, minimum display duration, and timeout rules per platform.

## Experience Notes

- Production splash visual must emphasise brand (logo, rotation cue) without interactive elements, keeping copy minimal to support localisation.
- Developer launcher should mirror the app’s typography but use a distinct colour theme or badge (e.g., "DEBUG MODE") to prevent accidental shipping.
- Launcher layout must scale from phones to tablets and web—consider responsive two-column layout for wide breakpoints.
- Provide documentation hook for automation (e.g., test IDs) so QA can skip splash in release builds or programmatically navigate via developer launcher in debug builds.
- Timeout and animation loop counts should be configurable to fine-tune UX without code changes (e.g., via constants or remote config, though not in scope for first iteration).
