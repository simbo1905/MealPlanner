---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a MealPlanner user, I want to access a settings screen where I can view my account information and manage application preferences, so that I can customize my experience and prepare for future features that will leverage these settings for meal planning and calendar display.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am viewing the home portrait screen, **When** I tap the settings icon (⚙️) in the header, **Then** the settings screen is displayed showing my account information and preference controls.
2. **Given** I am signed in with an account, **When** the settings screen loads, **Then** my registered email address is displayed in the Account section.
3. **Given** I am not signed in or my email is unavailable, **When** the settings screen loads, **Then** the Account section displays "Not signed in" as placeholder text.
4. **Given** I am viewing the settings screen for the first time, **When** the Preferences section loads, **Then** Feature A toggle is ON, Feature B toggle is OFF, Feature C toggle is OFF, and the weeks preference slider is set to 2.
5. **Given** I am viewing the settings screen, **When** I tap any feature toggle switch, **Then** the toggle state changes immediately without requiring confirmation or explicit save action.
6. **Given** I am viewing the settings screen, **When** I drag the weeks preference slider between positions 1 and 4, **Then** the displayed value updates in real-time and is persisted when I release the slider.
7. **Given** I have modified settings, **When** I tap the back button or swipe back to return to home, **Then** my changes are automatically saved and I return to the home screen in the same state I left it.
8. **Given** I have previously modified settings, **When** I close the app completely and reopen it, **Then** my settings persist and display the values I previously set.
9. **Given** I am viewing the settings screen on a device with rotation enabled, **When** I rotate the device, **Then** the settings screen remains visible and my current settings state is preserved during the rotation.
10. **Given** the settings screen is displayed, **When** I observe all interactive elements (toggles, slider, back button, settings icon), **Then** each element has a minimum 44×44 point tap target area for accessibility.

### Edge Cases
- User account email is temporarily unavailable or fails to load from backend
- Local storage persistence fails when saving settings changes
- Settings screen is accessed while background sync or data migration is in progress
- Device storage is full or corrupted when attempting to persist settings
- Multiple rapid toggle changes or slider adjustments occur within a short time window
- Settings screen is accessed on devices with very small screens or unusual aspect ratios
- User attempts to navigate away from settings screen while a setting change is being persisted
- App crashes or is force-closed immediately after a settings change but before persistence completes

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Settings screen MUST load and display within 300ms on modern mobile devices.
- **NFR-002**: Settings persistence operations MUST complete within 100ms to prevent perceived lag during user interactions.

## Experience Notes

- The settings icon is positioned in the top-right corner of the home portrait screen header for consistency with standard mobile user experience patterns.
- The Account section serves as a foundation for future authentication flows, account management, and backend synchronization features.
- Feature toggle labels ("Feature A", "Feature B", "Feature C") are placeholders that will be replaced with meaningful feature names when actual functionality is implemented.
- The weeks preference slider prepares the application for future calendar configuration where users can control the number of weeks displayed in meal planning views.
- Subtitle text below toggle labels (for feature descriptions) is optional in the initial design but can be added as features are defined.
- Discrete step markers on the slider (at positions 1, 2, 3, 4) are a design choice that can enhance usability but are not mandatory for the initial implementation.
- Optional avatar or user initials display in the Account section is noted for future enhancement but not required in the initial design.
- Settings changes are intentionally designed without confirmation dialogs to minimize friction and provide a modern, streamlined user experience.
- The settings screen remains accessible even when the user is not authenticated, ensuring that preferences can be configured before account creation.
