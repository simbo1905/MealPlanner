# Flutter Web Integration Testing HOWTO

This guide documents the reusable pattern we use to drive Flutter web integration tests from a Bash harness. It is deliberately app-agnostic so you can copy it into any Flutter repository—prototype or production—and wire it into that project's automation without leaking project-specific paths.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter (stable channel) installed via `mise` and pinned per-repo (`mise use flutter@<version>`). Confirm with `mise list` before running tests.
- Chrome installed at the default system location; the Flutter tool will spawn a debug-profile instance automatically.
- `chromedriver` installed (for macOS with Homebrew: `brew install chromedriver`). Keep the driver version aligned with the locally installed Chrome build.
- A dedicated `.tmp/` directory inside the Flutter project root for log and PID files; the script below will create it on demand.

## Directory Layout

```
<repo-root>/
  └── flutter_test_server.sh    # see script template below
  └── .tmp/                     # generated at runtime for logs + PID files
  └── integration_test/         # standard Flutter integration tests
  └── test_driver/              # entry-point used by flutter drive
```

Keep the harness script at the project root (next to `pubspec.yaml`) so relative paths to `integration_test/` and `test_driver/` remain stable.

## Script Template

Place the following content in `flutter_test_server.sh`, make it executable (`chmod +x flutter_test_server.sh`), and update the `FLUTTER_DRIVER_ENTRY` / `FLUTTER_TARGET` variables shown near the bottom to match your integration entry points. Everything else handles process orchestration, crash-proof cleanup, and logging.

echo "Test runner started in background."

echo "Log: $LOG_FILE"
```

## Invocation Pattern

Always wrap the script in `timeout` to prevent runaway sessions:

```bash
timeout 180 ./flutter_test_server.sh
```

Key runtime artifacts:

- PID file: `.tmp/flutter_test_server.sh.pid`
- Log file: `.tmp/flutter_test_server.sh.log`
- Chrome debug profile: temporary directory under `/var/folders/.../flutter_tools_*`

Tail the log in another terminal to watch progress:

```bash
tail -f .tmp/flutter_test_server.sh.log
```

The harness prints `All tests passed!` once the integration suite finishes. The script auto-terminates `flutter drive`, `chromedriver`, and any Chrome children. If the suite fails, the exit code surfaces immediately while the log captures the full trace.

## Adapting for Other Repositories

- Set `FLUTTER_DRIVER_ENTRY` and `FLUTTER_TARGET` to the files you want to exercise.
- If you need to run a subset of tests, replace the target path or pass `--dart-define` flags before the trailing `&`.
- Preserve the `.tmp/` layout so any tooling (CI monitors, Playwright, etc.) can tail the same log.
- Wire the script into your chosen task runner (plain shell alias, Makefile, npm script, etc.).

## Troubleshooting Checklist

- **SocketException: Connection refused** — Usually a race while Chrome spins up. Re-run after ensuring no stray `chromedriver` or Chrome instances remain (`pgrep -fl chromedriver` / `pgrep -fl flutter_tools_chrome_device`). The script already clears most cases, but verify manually if failures persist.
- **`mise WARN missing: flutter@...`** — Ensure the requested Flutter toolchain is installed via `mise install` and available on `PATH`.
- **Hanging runs** — Check `.tmp/flutter_test_server.sh.log` for the last timestamp. If the log stalls before tests execute, run `flutter clean` and retry to clear stale build artifacts.
- **CI environments without GUI** — The Flutter tool launches Chrome in headless mode automatically when running on web; no extra flags are required, but make sure the environment allows sandboxed Chrome. If not, add `--no-sandbox` to the `flutter drive` command.

## Related Documentation To Mirror

When transplanting this workflow into another Flutter project, replicate any existing test specs, bug reports, or driver notes so future agents understand:

- Which user flows each integration test covers.
- How to interpret generated screenshots or logs.
- Where to document regressions and fixes.

Keep those documents close to the script (e.g., alongside `integration_test/` or under a `docs/` directory) so the testing story stays discoverable.
