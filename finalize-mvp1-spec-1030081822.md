## Executive Summary
- Original prompt: Rebase with `--ours` against main to pull Firebase recipes/favorites artifacts, verify their presence, and deliver the requested fixes.
- User input summary:
  - Rebase the branch using an `--ours` strategy while preserving Firebase recipe/favorites code from main.
  - Assume prior steps failed and double-check Firebase datastore artifacts exist in this worktree.
  - Implement an in-memory recipe repository with ~12 mock entries, hardcoded auth for integration tests, and add a Chrome integration test that searches "Beef" and expects "Beef Tacos" without leaving Chrome processes running.
  - Use environment toggles (`INTEGRATION_TEST`) for provider switching per supplied code.
  - Run analyzer, unit/widget tests, and the new integration test sequence after implementation.
- Files changed: `lib/repositories/fakes/fake_recipes_v1_repository.dart`, `integration_test/recipe_search_smoke_test.dart`, `lib/providers/recipes_v1_provider.dart`, `lib/providers/auth_provider.dart`, `lib/widgets/recipe/recipe_search_autocomplete.dart`, documentation file (this report).
- Features delivered:
  - Environment-controlled swap between Firebase and fake recipe repositories aligned with provided specification.
  - Hardcoded integration-test user wiring through the auth provider flag.
  - Deterministic fake recipes repository exposing 12 dishes for search scenarios.
  - Chrome integration test covering recipe autocomplete search for "Beef" â†’ "Beef Tacos" using widget keys.
- Work outstanding:
  - Execute `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, and Chrome integration tests with `INTEGRATION_TEST` flag.
  - Capture `procs` output before and after the integration run and kill any stray Chrome processes if present.

## Chronological Narrative
1. Rebased the worktree against main using an `--ours` conflict strategy and cleaned up deleted documentation to complete the rebase cleanly.
2. Audited the Firebase recipes and favorites repository artifacts from main to confirm they now exist within this worktree.
3. Implemented the requested environment-driven provider switching for recipes and auth to enable integration-test overrides.
4. Added a dedicated fake recipes repository with twelve hardcoded dishes and surfaced the search text field via a stable key for automation support.
5. Authored a Chrome integration smoke test that launches the app with fake data, performs a "Beef" search, and asserts that "Beef Tacos" appears, while planning the pending analyzer and test execution sequence alongside Chrome process checks.
